### ## About The Project
**Foma** is a dynamic and responsive student forum designed to be a central hub for university students. Our goal is to create a platform for sharing information, discussing academic topics, and building communities around shared interests and activities (UKM).

This project focuses on creating a clean, intuitive, and mobile-first user interface, while also integrating dynamic content using JavaScript, jQuery, and public APIs to simulate a real-world web application.

### ## User Journey (The Plot)
To understand how the website works, let's follow the journey of a fictional student named **Alex**.

1.  **Discovery (As a Guest):** Alex gets a link to **Foma** from a classmate. Upon opening the homepage, Alex can immediately browse the latest discussions and see a list of upcoming campus events. All content is readable without an account.

2.  **Curiosity & Registration:** Alex wants to ask a question about a front-end course. When attempting to create a post, the site prompts Alex to log in. Having no account, Alex clicks "Sign Up," fills out the registration form, and successfully creates a new account.

3.  **Participation (As a Member):** Now logged in, Alex has full access. They navigate to the **Communities** page and find the "Front-End Enthusiasts" group. Inside, Alex can create a new thread, reply to other members' posts, and leave likes.

4.  **Contribution:** Alex hears about a free webinar and wants to share it. They go to the **Events** page and use the "Submit Event" feature. The submission is sent to an administrator for review before it's published for everyone to see.

5.  **Account Management:** Later, Alex wants to review all the questions they've asked. They visit their **Profile** page, which displays a complete history of all their posts and contributions.
